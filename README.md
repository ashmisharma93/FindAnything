# FindAnything
This repo consists a basic project on creating a Search Engine Website using Exa API.
Exa is an API that is used to search the content that best matches with the user's input unlike Google which matches the keywords from the user's input and the available web content.
Exa uses LLM model (Large Language Models) which is an artificial intelligence model that interprets and translates human-like text in various languages.
This project enables users to retrieve links based on their query from a variety of sources, including YouTube links, Instagram reels, X posts, and webpages.
